The elves are playing with a magical train ðŸš‚ that carries gifts. This train moves on a board represented by an array of strings.

The train consists of an engine (@), followed by its carriages (o), and must collect magical fruits (*) which serve as fuel. The movement of the train follows these rules:

You will receive two parameters board and mov.

board is an array of strings that represents the board:

    @ is the train's engine.
    o are the train's carriages.
    * is a magical fruit.
    Â· are empty spaces.

mov is a string that indicates the next movement of the train from the train's head @:

    'L': left
    'R': right
    'U': up
    'D': down.

With this information, you must return a string:

    'crash': If the train crashes into the edges of the board or itself.
    'eat': If the train collects a magical fruit (*).
    'none': If it moves without crashing or collecting any magical fruit.

Example:

board = ['Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·', '*Â·Â·Â·Â·', '@Â·Â·Â·Â·', 'oÂ·Â·Â·Â·', 'oÂ·Â·Â·Â·']

print(moveTrain(board, 'U'))  # âžž 'eat'
// Because the train moves up and finds a magical fruit

print(moveTrain(board, 'D'))  # âžž 'crash'
// The train moves down and the head crashes into itself

print(moveTrain(board, 'L'))  # âžž 'crash'
// The train moves to the left and crashes into the wall

print(moveTrain(board, 'R'))  # âžž 'none'
// The train moves to the right and there is empty space on the right
